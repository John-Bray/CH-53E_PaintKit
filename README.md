 Masks and overlays for livery creation

Use a combination of the **textureMap** and the **paintMask** to create a base livery. If you make a separate layer for the markings it will be easier to create different aircraft numbers/registration numbers.

Merge the paint and markings then use the **darkenMask** to create shadows. 

Use the **grotMask** to add dirt/scratches to taste. Change the colours, add noise, darken ..... whatever.

The **downwardsMask** and **upwardsMask** are best used to create an emboss effect.  If you don't know how to do this you could just use them to darken/lighten.

The enclosed TextureMain.psd file is a Photoshop implementation of these files. 

There are also two photoshop PBR examples.
